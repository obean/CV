## Oliver Beney

My background is in technical support and product integrations in the travel tech industry. Triaging the issues in products without the coding ability to fix them myself gave me the motivation to pursue a career in software development. This led me to complete the Makers Bootcamp and I am now **searching for a role as a Junior developer.** 

I'm a hard working person who enjoys working as part of a team, I'm searching for a place where I can continue to grow my skills as a developer.
